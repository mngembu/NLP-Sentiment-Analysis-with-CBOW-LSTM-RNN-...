# NLP-Sentiment-Analysis-with-CBOW-LSTM-RNN-...


This project focuses on predicting whether stock prices will increase or decrease based on sentimental analysis of news headlines. In this study I will use data available on Kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/avisheksood/stock-news-sentiment-analysismassive-dataset?select=Sentiment_Stock_data.csv. This is a huge dataset with 108,301 unique values, so I will only use a sample of 5000 observations.

I am exploring different algorithms to solve this use case. Each of them is eplored in a separate nobook as follows:

Using (Natural Language Processing) NLP Deep Learning's LSTM (Last Short Term Memory) RNN (Recurrent Neural Network)
Using a Machine Learning(ML) algorithm, Randomn Forest and NLP's Bag of Words (BOW)
Using a Machine Learning and Deep Learning (DL), amd employing Word2Vec's Continuous Bag of Words (CBOW) and Skip Grams

This project uses Python in ML and DL employs libraries like:
Pandas
Numpy
NLTK
Tensorfow
Gensim
